###Jenny has an awesome pizza shop called Pizza 3001 and as the business owner she wants to:
- Have a page which is private and shows her sales data.
- Have the data broken down by store, hourly sales, and deliveries.
- Give her customers a public facing website which shows some pics of her tasty pizza, and gives them information about hours and store locations.
- The ability to add new stores to the existing data structure easily to return sales information for potential upcoming locations.
- To be able to see all of her data displayed in a relevant way, which is easy for her to interpret and use as she needs.

###As a Developer I want to:
- Structure the data for Jenny in a way which makes it easy for her to get all of the information she needs to run her business efectively.
- Have a public facing website that features Pizza 3001 and its locations/hours and captures the essense of the shop for the user.
- Display all the pictures Jenny gave me in a way which doesn't make the user want to cover their eyes with the pizza of a competitor.  
- Create a form which is simple and easy to use to allow for new store locations to be added without hassle.
